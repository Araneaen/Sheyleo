THE ROMS DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
This is just a folder that contains shortcuts to the roms folder of each emulator.

-To play FC2 FBNeo open "FBNeo ROMs", if it is an arcade game place your rom in .zip format in that folder, if it is a console game open the corresponding console folder and place your rom there.

-To play FC1 FBAlpha open "FC1 ROMs" and place your roms in .zip format there.

-To play SNES9x open "SNES9x ROMs" and place your roms in .zip format there.

-To play Flycast open "Flycast ROMs" and place your roms there.

Common problems:
- I get an error saying "xxxx.zip was not found": check that the rom is in the correct folder with the same name as the error exposes and as .zip.
- Don't forget that to play neogeo games you need besides the game rom, the bios files "neogeo.zip".
- I get an error saying "xxxx.zip was found": It seems that you have all the files well located but the rom is incompatible, you need to have roms compatible with fbneo (romset 0.2.97.43 or 0.2.97.44) for FC2 or compatible with fbalpha (romset 0.2.96.74) for FC1. FC1 roms don't work on FC2.
- I get an error saying "there was a problem starting SomeGame(94561 usa)": problem similar to above, you are using an old rom that's missing a .key file in the zip and you need one that contains it.
